An application built using Python for data cleaning and analytics. 
The GUI is built with Tkinter, and allows for a csv file to be loaded, 
parsed to json, and saved in a new directory. The saved json can then be 
cleaned (e.g. removal of white spaces, data type standardisation etc) and 
re-saved, before being loaded into the data analytics window. Here, the 
dataset can be manipulated, averages calculated, and visualisations displayed. 

Pandas, Tkinter, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib libraries are required. 

Dataset must have valid headers.
