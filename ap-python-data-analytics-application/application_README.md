An application built using Python for data cleaning and analytics. 
The GUI is built with Tkinter, and allows for a csv file to be loaded, 
parsed to json, and saved in a new directory. The saved json can then be 
cleaned (e.g. removal of white spaces, data type standardisation etc) and re-saved,
before being loaded into the data analytics window. Here, the dataset can be 
manipulated, averages calculated, and visualisations displayed. Pandas and Seaborn
packages are also used. Dataset must have valid headers.
